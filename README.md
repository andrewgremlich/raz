# raz

raz is my first attempt to make a game based off of socket.io.  The first try went rather bad and rushed, but a while later I thought I could try it again with some new tricks.  I really would like to make games that other people could try out and have fun.

#### ideas to implement?

1. teleport option?
2. have the enemy motion be (AI controlled)[https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-javascript-machine-learning-libraries-to-use-in-your-app-c49772cca46c] through tensor flow or (neurojs?)[https://github.com/janhuenermann/neurojs]?
3. Have the player motion be controlled through (motion tilt of phone)[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/native-hardware/device-orientation/]?
4. use wasm!!!  (:D)[https://www.hellorust.com/demos/canvas/index.html]
5. Multiplayer!
